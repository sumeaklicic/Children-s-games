# Children-s-games
Using Matlab, I created a GUI application with 3 simple children's games (guessing a random number, a math game with 4 basic operations and paper/rock/scissors)

Using Matlab GUI I created 3 simple games that anyone can use. The goal is to make the games easy to use, yet interesting and useful. Using basic math operations or just a game of chance, each of the games can be played easily.

After the game is launched, the first window appears where the user sees all the games we have to offer. The user can select the desired game. To launch the game they want, they just need to click on the button with the name of their desired game.

The window has three components with images, located above the buttons. Under each picture there is a corresponding button that takes us to the next window. The same functionality is behind each button.

The game is called math trap. Single-digit numbers and basic mathematical operations appear randomly through the program. The user has 3 lives, and with each wrong answer he loses one life. The user answers the questions by clicking on the button with the answer that he thinks is correct. On the right, the number of correct answers changes as the user answers correctly. The aim of the game is to learn basic mathematics and quick thinking. The design is simple, but effective because it offers all the necessary information. Label and Button components were used on the window.

The aim of the game is for the user to play the popular game paper rock scissors with the computer. The user is offered to choose which of the elements he wants, and the computer randomly chooses one of the elements. It is written who chose what and the winner is chosen. The moment the computer wins, the user loses, but a window appears where he can try again.

The game continues until the user wins. The moment the computer's choice overrides the user's, the user loses and a message appears to that effect. The user still has the right to their own choice.

The third game asks for the entry of a number from 1 to 100. If we enter a smaller or larger number than requested, it is indicated below so that we know which way to move on. When entering correctly, a message is printed that the number is correct and how many attempts it took to guess the number is printed.
